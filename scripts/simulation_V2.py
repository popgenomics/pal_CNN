#Â TODO : effet du biais

# 3 modes of speciation:
#	D1: within a clade, creating a new lineage
#	D2: origination from not sampled specimen/species of a new clade
#	D3: within a clade, creating a new lineage but replace the original lineage i the deme

# general model:
# 3 modes of extinction:
#	E1: extinction impacting only a single lineage, immediatly killing this lineage
#	E2: extinction impacting only a genus, immediatly killing a given percentage of lineages of this clade (pE2 = proportion of lineages extincted during an E2 event)
#	E3: extinction impacting only a geographic area, immediatly killin a given percentage of lineage within a concerned geography

# colonization:
#	C1: a given lineage has a given probability of moving into a different geographic area (but still the same lineage)
